Springer's manuscript system does not permit files with extension .py to be
uploaded, even if they are in a zip file.  For this reason, I have renamed the
Python script files from *.py to *.py.txt.  You can rename (if you like) by
removing the .txt extension and running them as follows:

$ mv rolling_disk.py.txt rolling_disk.py
$ mv real_roots_steady.py.txt real_roots_steady.py
$ python rolling_disk.py
$ python real_roots_steady.py

In the event you cannot run the script files, the output of the two scripts are
included as

 * rolling_disk_output.txt
 * rolling_disk_feasibility_regions.pdf

These two files are the result of running the two .py files.

Additionally, all .tex sources, source code, and other scripts, along with a
complete commit history for the paper can be found here
